The comments to my blog posts were implemented using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). The instructions for installing Disqus with Jekyll was very clear and straight-forward. I simply had to create an account on Disqus, add some information about my website, and then copy-paste the code which displays the comment section.

### Open graph
Open Graph makes it possible for you to have your site shared on social media by being presented as a graph object including (but not limited to) your page title, description and an image. This is done by adding meta tags within your head tag, which gives details on what to display when your website or web page is being linked to. I chose to include:
* title
* type (website)
* url
* image
* image:width
* image:height
